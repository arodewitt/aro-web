        <h2>Reveries</h2>
        <p>This project tells a personal story inspired by the This American Life Rest Stop episode. The episode depicts the rest stop as hosting a series of fleeting, impermanent encounters that can't ever be perfectly reconstructed. My own association with road trips comes from the 9-hour drive my family took from Chicago to Kansas City for Thanksgiving.</p>
        <p>I hijacked a recognizable form, air fresheners, which use scents to try to bring you to another time or place but don't ever really succeed. I fabricated and packaged air fresheners using sticker paper, cardboard, vellum, and cardstock drawing viewers in with a commercial surface and surprising them with the personal nature of the content.</p>
